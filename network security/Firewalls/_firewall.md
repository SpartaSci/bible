> A **firewall** is a part of a computer system or network that is designed to block unauthorized access while permitting outward communication.

> A **firewall** is a device or program that controls the flow of network traffic between networks or hosts that employ differing security postures. 

> Both the definitions are correct and explain in a clear way what a firewall is, a security countermeasure.



**Firewalls typically are used to define zone borders.**

> [!Attention] 
> If the firewall is not the only point to enter or to exit the network, it never guarantees security to the network; so, this is achieved by physically blocking all access to the local network except via the firewall.
