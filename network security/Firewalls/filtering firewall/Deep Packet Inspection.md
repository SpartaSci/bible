# Deep Packet Inspection

Deep Packet Inspection is a Firewall type that is able to inspect the packet payloads in order to discover and to **block malware** or to **stop data leaks** or to perform **content policy enforcement**. By the way if the payload is encrypted, the DPI is not able to perform its controls.

For example, a company can decide, if it wants to encrypt its traffic, to perform encryption at the border of the company (before to exit) because in this way an internal DPI can inspect the traffic, otherwise the inspection will be useless.
