# Filtering

**different filters** are applied depending on the Layer to which the packet belongs and depending on the information that the packets carry on inside themselves.


Layer 2 -> [[network security/Firewalls/filtering firewall/Ethernet Firewall|Ethernet Firewall]]

Layer 3 based on IP header and some fields of TCP header -> [[network security/Firewalls/filtering firewall/Packet Filter|Packet Filter]]

Layer 5/7 -> [[network security/Firewalls/filtering firewall/Deep Packet Inspection|Deep Packet Inspection]] and [[network security/Firewalls/filtering firewall/Application firewall|Application firewall]]



The higher is the layer, more time is needed, the security is higher
