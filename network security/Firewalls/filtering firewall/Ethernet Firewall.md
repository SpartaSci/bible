Ethernet Firewall is a firewall used to set up and maintain the tables of rules (inside the Linux kernel) that inspect Ethernet frames.
It is analogous to the packet filter, but less complicated, due to the fact that the Ethernet protocol is much simpler than the IP protocol

**MAC Address Filtering**: it is possible to filter traffic based on the MAC address of the sender or receiver. This can be particularly helpful for ensuring specific devices have (or do not have) network access.

**Virtual LAN (VLAN) Tagging**: can be used to allow or block specific VLANs, providing control over which frames are allowed to pass through certain ports.
