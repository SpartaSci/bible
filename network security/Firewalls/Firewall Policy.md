## Firewall Policy
>A **firewall policy** dictates how firewalls should handle network traffic for specific IP addresses and address ranges, protocols, applications, and content types (e.g., active content) based on the organizationâ€™s
information security policies.

The Firewall Policy is mainly composed by:
- (ordered) set of [[network security/Firewalls/Firewall Rule|rules]];
- a [[network security/Firewalls/default action|default action]];
- a [[network security/Firewalls/resolution strategy|resolution strategy]]


N.B. Each Interface of Firewall has a configured Firewall Policy
- E.g, Interface where the packet arrives on and the Interface where the packet will go out on
