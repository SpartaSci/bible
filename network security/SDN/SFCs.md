> A **Service Function Chain (SFC)** is a set of middle-boxes representing network function services to be applied on some packets. These middle-boxes are dedicated hardware appliances implementing a single service.



The **problems** related to SFC are:
- Hardware resources are not used at best.
- When the service chain need to be modified, the service is disrupted.
- Is not easy to differentiate service among tenants. If a tenant buys a secure access to the Internet while a other tenants donâ€™t, it is very complex to avoid that the traffic of the other tenants pass through the firewall. Ideally only the traffic of the first tenant should pass through the firewall.


A **possible solution** to solve, or mitigate, these problems can be the use of [[network security/SDN/_SDN - Software Defined Networking|SDN]]. An [[network security/SDN/OpenFlow|OpenFlow]] switch can be installed to connect all boxes together. Then, OF rules can be used to allow each user to access only services for which it paid. Using SDN:
- Is possible to give per-user services.
- Is possible to increment hardware usage because now the boxes are shared.
- Is possible to avoid total service disruption because if a box need to be replaced/modified, only the traffic that use the specific middle-box will be disrupted.
