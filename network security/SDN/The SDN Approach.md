**Adaptability**: Networks must adjust and respond dynamically, based on application needs, business policy, and network conditions

**Automation**: Policy changes must be automatically propagated so that manual work and errors can be reduced

**Maintainability**: Introduction of new features and capabilities must be seamless with minimal disruption of operations

**Model management**: Network management software must allow management of the network at a model level, rather than implementing conceptual changes by reconfiguring individual network elements

**Mobility**: Control functionality must accommodate mobility, including mobile user devices and virtual servers

**Integrated security**: Network applications must integrate seamless security as a core service instead of as an add-on solution

**On-demand scaling**: Implementations must have the ability to scale up or scale down the network and its services to support on-demand requests
