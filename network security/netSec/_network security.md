There are some groups called Security Working Groups which are created to define and distribute rules about the cybersecurity. The most important group is the **NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and its mission is to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness.

Another important group is the **ISO/IEC 27000-series** which provides best practice recommendations on information security management. Every branch of cybersecurity typically has got some related security working groups. For example, the most important group for cloud security is the
**Cloud Security Alliance** which is a not-for-profit organization with the mission to “promote the use of best practices for providing security assurance within Cloud Computing, and to provide education on the uses of Cloud Computing to help secure all other forms of computing”.

When we talk about network security, there are some important concepts:

[[cybersec/_problem/threat|Threat]]: an event that can cause harm to a system. It can damage the system’s reliability and demote [[cybersec/_properties/confidentiality|confidentiality]], [[cybersec/_properties/integrity|integrity]] and/or [[cybersec/_properties/availability|availability]] ([[cybersec/_properties/_security properties|CIA]]) of stored information. Threats can be malicious such as intentional alteration of sensitive data or can be accidental such as unintentional deletion of a file or problem arisen from erroneous calculation. 
Some threats can be:
- [[cybersec/attacks/sniffing|eavesdropping]]: sniffing data packets during network transmission to catch sensitive information.
- **fraud**: It is materialized through fallacious transactions and misleading alteration of data to make some illegitimate gains.
- **theft**: the stealing of trade secrets or data for gain and unlawful disclosure of information to cause harm.
- **sabotage**: performed through various means like disrupting data integrity (referred as data sabotage), delaying production, denial-of-service (DoS) attack and so on.
- **external attack**: examples are the insertion of a malicious code or virus to an application or system and the keylogger attack.

[[cybersec/_problem/vulnerability|Vulnerability]]: a flaw or weakness in system security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be exercised (accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and result in a security breach or a violation of the system’s security policy. Or in a more compact way, a weakness of an asset or group of assets that can be exploited by one or more threats.

[[cybersec/_problem/issue|Issue]]: it is also called security issue and it is a a general term to address something, like an event or action, a software or hardware misconfiguration, or an application loophole, that is not as it supposedly should be in the context of security.

[[cybersec/_problem/attack|Attack]]: attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of an asset
