Due to the difficulty of creating a secure cloud environment, Security as-a-Service (SECaaS) was developed.

**Security as a Service** is a package of security services offered by a service (cloud) provider that offloads much of the security responsibility from a company to the security service provider.

SECaaS can be considered a specific type of Software as a Service ([[network/SaaS|SaaS]]). SECaaS is available on-demand, since it can provide more or fewer services, changing the price accordingly (the more you use, the more you pay); and over the network of the cloud (security) provider.


The **advantages** of SECaaS are:
- Cost efficiency.
- Scalability.
- Fast provisioning.
- Continuous updates.
- Focus on core competencies.

The [CSA](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/) has identified the following categories:
- Identity and access management
- Data loss prevention
- Web security
- E-mail security
- Security assessments
- Intrusion management
- Security information and event management
- Encryption
- Business continuity and disaster recovery
- Network security
