Cloud services spread over multiple countries and continents. *Different regions have different regulatory requirements*. In cloud computing, it becomes necessary to observe how all these overlapping regulatory requirements are being maintained by the service provider in a coherent manner. This difficult task is called **compliance**.


Compliance agreements can be made between a **Cloud Service Provider** and **service consumers** through [[network security/Cloud Computing/SLA - Service-Level Agreements|SLA]] contracts that must address all compliance-related issues and their possible solutions when a violation is observed. Moreover, managing compliance issues is not only the responsibility of the provider but also of the consumers, who have roles to play in fulfilling compliance requirements. Typically, compliance is related to regulatory, performance, security, and legal aspects. 


To maintain compliance requirements, **system auditing** and **system monitoring** can be performed. These tasks in cloud computing can be done either by the provider or the consumer in order to observe events, understand performance, maintain system integrity, and assess whether all policies are being satisfied.

**System audit** is a regular activity to evaluate system performance, security controls, information privacy, compliance, and so on. In other words, an audit is a function that checks that standards, methods, or practices are followed. 
The audit can be:
- **Internal audit**: This is performed by employees (auditors internal to the organization). Their purposes are to identify the risks related to performance, security, and compliance issues and to try to put in place countermeasures to mitigate those issues.
- **External audit**: This is performed by professional auditors external to the organization. Typically, external auditing is done by the organization to build confidence among clients and shareholders.



**System monitoring** is a regular activity that keeps track of all activities performed on the system, such as intrusion detection and other activities, in order to detect if something unusual (a possible
attack, for example) is happening.
