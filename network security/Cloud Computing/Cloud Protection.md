To obtain cloud protection, the main security principles, such as [[network security/_network security#security by design|Security by design]], [[network security/_network security#zero trust|Zero Trust]] and [[network security/_network security#open design|Open Design]] Principle, can be used. But, the NIST specified some Guidelines on Cloud Security for managing security and privacy issues in cloud computing.

The key **guidelines** include:
- Carefully plan the security and privacy aspects of cloud computing solutions before implementing them.
- Define the [[network/Cloud Delivery Model|Cloud Delivery Model]] to be used.
- Ensure that a cloud computing solution—both cloud resources and cloud-based applications—satisfy organizational security and privacy requirements.
- Maintain accountability (or responsibility) over the privacy and security of data and applications deployed in public cloud computing environments.


Moreover some macro are discussed into the guideline to reach cloud security:
- **Governance**: extend organizational practices to the design, implementation, testing, use, and monitoring of deployed or engaged services. The idea is to put in place audit mechanisms and tools to ensure organizational practices are followed throughout the system life-cycle.
- [[network security/Cloud Computing/Compliance|Compliance]]: understand the various types of laws and regulations that impose security and privacy obligations on the organization and potentially impact cloud computing, particularly those involving data location, privacy and security controls, records management, and electronic discovery requirements.
- **Trust**: ensure that service arrangements (SLAs) have sufficient means to allow visibility into the security and privacy controls and processes employed by the cloud provider, and their performance over time. Continuously monitor the security state of the information system to support ongoing risk management decisions.
- **Architecture**: understand the underlying technologies that the cloud provider uses to provision services.
- **Identity and access management**: ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to secure authentication, authorization, and other identity and access management functions, and are suitable for the organization.
- **Software isolation**: understand virtualization and other logical isolation techniques that the cloud provider employs in its multi-tenant software architecture, and evaluate the risks involved for the organization.
- **Data protection**: evaluate the suitability of the cloud provider’s data management solutions for the organizational data concerned and the ability to control access to data, to secure data while at rest, in transit, and in use, and to sanitize data.
- **Availability**: understand the contract (SLAs) provisions and procedures for availability, data backup and recovery, and disaster recovery, and ensure that they meet the organization’s continuity and contingency planning requirements.
- **Incident response**: understand the contract (SLAs) provisions and procedures for incident response and ensure that they meet the requirements of the organization.
