# security issue

The security issues associated with cloud computing can be viewed from two angles:

**The cloud provider** (providing [[network/SaaS|SaaS]], [[network/PaaS|PaaS]] or [[network/IaaS|IaaS]]) must ensure security of its own infrastructure as well as of the clientsâ€™ data and applications. Experience and expertise of the provider play a significant role in this context.

**The cloud consumer** must verify and make sure that the provider has employed all possible security measures to make the services secure.

To summarize, both parties should have a clear idea about their own responsibilities towards security management; in other words, responsibility should be shared between cloud provider and consumer.

**The Service-Level Agreements ([[network security/Cloud Computing/SLA - Service-Level Agreements|SLAs]])** are used to establish a trust relationship between service providers and consumers. The SLA details the service-level capabilities promised by the providers to be delivered and requirements/expectations stated by consumers. These details establish a legal binding for both the parties and works as reference in any dispute. Moreover it is the document that allows to assign responsibility to each part and to solve a possible dispute, maybe about *whose fault is it?* after an attack.

The conventional security concerns ([[network security/Cloud Computing/Cloud problems/Cloud Threats|Threats]], [[network security/Cloud Computing/Cloud problems/Cloud Vulnerabilities|Vulnerabilities]], [[network security/Cloud Computing/Cloud problems/Cloud Issues|Issues]], and [[network security/Cloud Computing/Cloud problems/Cloud Attacks|Attacks]]) also persist in cloud computing systems and require a cloud-specific perspective for their mitigation.
