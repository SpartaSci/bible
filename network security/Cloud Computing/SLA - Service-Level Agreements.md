SLAs are used to establish a trust relationship between service providers and consumers. The SLA details the service-level capabilities promised by the providers to be delivered and requirements/expectations stated by consumers. These details establish a legal binding for both the parties and works as reference in any dispute. Moreover it is the document that allows to assign responsibility to each part and to solve a possible dispute, maybe about *whose fault is it?* after an attack.
