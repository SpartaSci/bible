> A cyclic group is a [[crypto/_math/Group|group]] that is **generated** by a single element




**Order of an element**
The order $ord(a)$ of an element $a$ of a group $(G,o)$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $$a^k=a \ o \ a ... = 1$$ where 1 is the identity element of G


A group which contains an element $a$ with maximum order $ord(a) = |G|$ is said to be **cyclic**

that $a$ is a **generator**
