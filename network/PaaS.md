### PaaS (Platform as a Service)

**Definition:** PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. It includes development tools, database management systems, and middleware.

**Examples:**

- Google App Engine
- Microsoft Azure App Service
- Heroku
- Red Hat OpenShift

**Advantages:**

1. **Development Focus:** Allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about infrastructure.
2. **Efficiency:** Simplifies the development process with pre-built components and services.
3. **Scalability:** Easy to scale applications based on demand.
4. **Integration:** Seamless integration with databases, messaging systems, and other services.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Control:** Less control over the underlying infrastructure.
2. **Lock-In:** Potential for vendor lock-in, making it difficult to migrate applications to other platforms.
3. **Customization:** Limited customization options for the underlying platform.
