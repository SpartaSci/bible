> **Network Address Translation (NAT)** is a technique used in computer networks to modify network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit. NAT is primarily used to allow multiple devices on a local (private) network to share a single public IP address when accessing external networks, like the internet. This is common in home networks or small business networks where internet service providers (ISPs) typically allocate only one public IP address.
