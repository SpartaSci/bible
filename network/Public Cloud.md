### Public Cloud

**Definition:** A public cloud is a computing environment where services are provided over the internet by third-party providers. These services are available to multiple customers, and resources are shared among them.

**Advantages:**

1. **Cost-Effective:** Typically more cost-effective due to shared resources and economies of scale.
2. **Scalability:** Easily scalable, allowing businesses to quickly increase or decrease resources based on demand.
3. **Maintenance:** Providers handle maintenance and updates, reducing the burden on in-house IT teams.
4. **Accessibility:** Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, promoting remote work and collaboration.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Security and Privacy:** Shared resources can present security and privacy concerns, although many public cloud providers offer robust security measures.
2. **Compliance:** Can be more challenging to meet certain regulatory and compliance requirements.
3. **Control:** Less control over the infrastructure and underlying hardware.
