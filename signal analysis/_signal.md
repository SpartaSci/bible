> is a function that conveys **information** about a phenomenon.


# energy


$$E(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\lvert x(t) \rvert^2 dt  $$
# power 
$$P(x) = \lim_{a\to\infty} \frac{1}{2a} \int_{-a}^{a}\lvert x(t) \rvert^2 dt  $$

# nyquist theorem - sampling 
> a continuous time signal can be sampled and perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the **sampling frequency** is greater than **twice the band** of the signal



# bandwidth
[[signal analysis/bandwidth|bandwidth]]


# modulation
%%multiplying a signal by a sinusoidal function, result in a frequency shift. Therefore, the spectrum in the frequency domain is shifted %%
> is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called **carrier signal** with a separate signal called th **modulation signal** that typically contains information to be transmitted.

# frequency multiplexing
> different signals with overlapping bandwidth can be frequency-modulated in different portions of the spectrum. Each modulated with different cosines. Once they are received they can be de-multiplexed without distortion
