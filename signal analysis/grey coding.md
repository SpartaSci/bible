> is a strategy for **mapping bits to symbols** so that the number of bit errors is minimized

Most likely symbol errors are adjacent levels.

The number of bits that differs between adjacent levels is minimized

End-goal: gray coding achieves 1 bit difference between adjacent levels, enforcing the error to be at maximum on 1 bit only
