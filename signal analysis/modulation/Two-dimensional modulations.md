> signals cam be represented over 2 orthonormal basis. A set of signal points $s_i$ is called a **constellation**

Large constellation -> many bits per symbol
More *bandwidth efficiency* 
More error prone
The shape of the constellation can be used to minimize error probability by keeping symbols as far as possible

# Symmetric M-QAM
The symmetric M-QAM presents the following properties:
- M is the total number of signal points -> symbol
- $\sqrt{M}$ signal levels on each axis
- The constellation is said to be symmetric -> $M=K^2$ for some K
-
