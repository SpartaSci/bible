>analog data on a analog carrier

# Amplitude Modulation (AM)
> the amplitude of high-carrier signal is varied according to the instantaneous **amplitude** of the modulating message signal m(t)

# Frequency Modulation (FM)

>the carrier amplitude remains constant, but the **carrier frequency** is changed by the modulating signal m(t)


# Phase Modulation (PM)
>the **phase** of a carrier signal is modulated to follow the changing signal amplitude of the message signal

the phase modulation encodes a message signal m(t) as variations in the instantaneous phase of carrier wave
