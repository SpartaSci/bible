# Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
> two different amplitude to represent 0 and 1

# Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
> two different frequencies to represent 0 and 1

# Phase Shift Key (PSK)
> two different phases to represent 0 and 1

Since all the symbols have the same energy, operating close to the saturation region of a power amplifier does not cause distortion, resulting in efficient use of the amplifier.
