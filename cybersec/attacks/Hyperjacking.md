Another type of attack, related to the VM Monitor/Manager (VMM), is called **Hyperjacking** which means that the control of VMM or hypervisor is under the attacker. The attacker can monitor other virtual machines, access the shared infrastructure, monitor the CPU utilization or can bring the VMM shutting down.
