In wireless communication Dos attacks can be achieved by means of jamming

> Jamming involves broadcasting interference signal over a broad spectral band


# active (constant)
these jammers continuously send out a radio signal, blocking the communication of users. However, they require high power.

# reactive
these jammers remain idle until they sense transmission activities occurring in the channel, after which they transmit jammeing signals.
