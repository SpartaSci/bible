A **hash function** is any [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") that can be used to map [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing) "Data (computing)") of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, though there are some hash functions that support variable length output. The values returned by a hash function are called _hash values, hash codes, hash digests, digests,_ or simply _hashes_
