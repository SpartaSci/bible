Rowhammer is a compute security exploit that takes advantage of an unintended and undesirable side effect of [[electronics/_type of memory/DRAM|DRAM]], in which memory cells interact electrically between themselves by leaking their charges, possibly changing the contents of **nearby memory rows**.
This attacks the data memory integrity
