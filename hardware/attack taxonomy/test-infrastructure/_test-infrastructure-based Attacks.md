[[hardware/attack taxonomy/test-infrastructure/scan chain|scan chain]] device are final device, that just have some features to help [[hardware/watermarking/testing|testing]] them. **They are already in the market**



Among the plethora of test infrastructures:
- scan chains
- standard [[hardware/attack taxonomy/test-infrastructure/IEEE 1149.1|IEEE 1149.1]]
- [JTAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG) infrastructure
- [ATPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_test_pattern_generation)


**Issue**: In scan-based devices, the scan chains could provide a natural way to access the content of ALL the storage devices (flip-flip and register) connected to a scan chain
