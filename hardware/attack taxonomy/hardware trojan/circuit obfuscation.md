> hide the true purpose of the circuit from the manufacturer

[[hardware/VLSI and IP/FPGA|FPGA]]-based -> foundry never gets design

xor obfuscation -> foundry gets design but not *xor key*

Adding XOR gates you can create a situation where the true function of the circuit is hidden unless you know the specific keys or configurations used in the xor gates. 

This added layer of complexity makes it harder for an attacker to determinate where and how to insert a [[hardware/attack taxonomy/hardware trojan/_hardware trojan|trojan]]
