**Trigger** determines *how* the payload is activated:
- always, uncommon because easily detectable
- internal trigger
- external trigger


A good trigger should be an event that happens very rarely and must not be detected during regular testing

Combining multiple signals to create the trigger condition can further obscure the trojan

Example

uncommon flag like *divide by 0*
temperature
capacitor
