**pre-silicon**:
- **formal verification**: is a mathematical method used to analyze the chip and prove its functional characteristics
- trusted [[hardware/_intro/chain/fabrication|foundry]]


**post-silicon**: runtime monitoring
- [[hardware/attack taxonomy/invasive attacks/reverse engineering|reverse engineering]] can used to analyze the chip post-manufacturing and ensure everything is exactly as it should be. X-ray can be used to avoid physically opening
