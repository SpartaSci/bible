> splitting the [[hardware/_intro/chain/fabrication|manufacturing]] process across multiple foundries


By doing this you ensure that no single foundry has access to the complete layout, making it significantly harder for everyone to [[hardware/attack taxonomy/invasive attacks/reverse engineering|reverse engineering]] or insert [[hardware/attack taxonomy/hardware trojan/_hardware trojan|trojan]] into the design not knowing the final [[hardware/VLSI and IP/routing|routing]]


This process increase manufacturing complexity and cost

One foundry can be trusted (the one that assembles all the pieces)
