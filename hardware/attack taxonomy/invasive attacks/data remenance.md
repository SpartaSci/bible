> **data remenance** is the residual information remaining on storage media after clearing, due to **residual charge** of components and how memory cells work at physics level


This result may result **from**:
- data being left intact by **nominal** file **deletion** operation
- by **reformatting** of storage media that does not remove data previously written to the media
- through **physical properties** of the storage media that allow previously written data to be recovered

an attacker with physical access to a computing system may just disconnect the memory chips and then retrive their content at disconnection time by analyzing them offline

non-volatile memory is easier since the data remain stored

[[electronics/_type of memory/DRAM|volatile memory]] are more interresting


## cold boot attack

 a cold boot attack is a process for obtaining unauthorized access to a computer's encryption keys when the computer is left physically unattended.
