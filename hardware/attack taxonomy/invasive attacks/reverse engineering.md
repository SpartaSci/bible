> aim at understand the structure of a semiconductor device and its functions, like stealing the [[hardware/VLSI and IP/Intellectual Properties|IP]] of the design

It can lead to [[hardware/conterfeit/_counterfeiting|counterfeiting]] and [[hardware/attack taxonomy/hardware trojan/_hardware trojan|_hardware trojan]] injection

to protect -> increase [[hardware/PCB/_PCB - printed circuit board#good practises|_PCB - printed circuit board]] design resilience
