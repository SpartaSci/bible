> **Weakness** in the secure system

**Physical Attacks**: these involve physically manipulating the hardware, such as using lasers or altering the temperature, to induce errors. The idea is to create stress on the hardware to trigger some reaction

**[[hardware/attack taxonomy/hardware trojan/_hardware trojan|trojan]] Horses**

**IP Piracy**

**IC Piracy & [[hardware/conterfeit/_counterfeiting|counterfeiting]]: unauthorized production of wafer, cloning, overproduction

**Backdoor**, intentional weaknesses insert into hardware or software to provide unauthorized access.  ^f591a4

**Tampering**: this is the alteration of physical component, which is a major concern for automotive products. This type of attack is common because it can be  relatively inexpensive and straightforward. FPGA bitstream modifications

[[hardware/attack taxonomy/invasive attacks/reverse engineering|reverse engineering]]: this involves taking a product apart to understand its design and functionality, then reproducing it.

**Functional Bugs**: Flaws in the system that can expose information or cause malfunctions.

[[hardware/attack taxonomy/side channel/_side channel|side channel]] **Bug**: These exploit information leaked through indirect means such us power consumption or electromagnetic emissions, ad example an attacker might infer information about crypto keys
