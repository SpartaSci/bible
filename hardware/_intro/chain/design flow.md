# design
1. **functional description**: this stage outline what the hardware is supposed to do
2. **functional specification**: here, we define not only the functionality but also the input ranges, timing requirements, and other relevant parameters


1. **implementation modeling**: we model the design using tools and [[hardware/VLSI and IP/RTL - register transfer level|RTL]] and adding [[hardware/VLSI and IP/Intellectual Properties|IP]]
2. [[hardware/VLSI and IP/logic synthesis|logic synthesis]] map [[hardware/VLSI and IP/RTL - register transfer level|RTL]] to [[hardware/VLSI and IP/netlist|netlist]]
3. [[hardware/VLSI and IP/floorplanning|floorplanning]]
4. [[hardware/VLSI and IP/placement|placement]]
5. [[hardware/VLSI and IP/routing|routing]]


1. fabrication
2. packaging
3. [[hardware/watermarking/testing|testing]]
