# cycle in securing a system
>**Security assessment**: this process includes defining **what** you need to **protect**. This includes defining security requirements and implementing measures to meet those requirements

> **Security architecture**: here you design the system based on the security requirements. This involves creating a robust architecture that can withstand potential threats

>**Security validation**: this involves checking the design against the threat model. This includes verifying the architecture and performing security test


> [!note] everything has been done manually and based on your skill 

> **Design validation**: Formal methods come to play, they include rigorous mathematical technique to verify the correctness of your design. Testing on models, rather than physical hardware. Penetrating testing (that continues throughout the system's lifecycle)

>**Design assurance**: you ensure that the design meets all the security requirements and is ready for production. Includes a final round of testing and validation.
