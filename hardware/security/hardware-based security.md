# Principles of Computer Architecture
- Caching
	- E.g. caching frequently used data in a small but fast memory helps hide data access latencies.
- Pipelining
	- E.g. break processing of an instruction into smaller chunks that can each be executed sequentially reduces critical path of logic and improves performance.
- Predicting
	- E.g. predict control flow direction or data values before they are actually computed allows code to execute speculatively.
- Parallelizing
	- E.g. processing multiple data in parallel allows for more computation to be done concurrently.
- Use of indirection
	- E.g. virtual to physical mapping abstracts away physical details of the system.
- Specialization
	- E.g. custom instructions use dedicated circuits to implement operations that otherwise would be slower using regular processor instructions
