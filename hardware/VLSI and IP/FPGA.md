> these devices have a predefined but flexible structure that can be programmed to implement various functions


# FPGA Place & Route

We have less to do in respect to [[hardware/VLSI and IP/floorplanning|floorplanning]] since the structure is predefined by the manufacturer.

[[hardware/VLSI and IP/placement|placement]]

[[hardware/VLSI and IP/routing|routing]]


The result is a **bit-stream** which configures the [[hardware/VLSI and IP/_VLSI - Very Large Scale Integration#Programmable logic devices (PLDs)|PLD]] according with the result obtained after P&R

The bit-stream is then loaded on the PLD memory, SRAM or flash.

Some FPGAs uses fuse or antifure technology
