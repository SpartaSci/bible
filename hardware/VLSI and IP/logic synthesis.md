> **Logic synthesis** is a process by which an abstract specification of desired circuit behavior, at [[hardware/VLSI and IP/RTL - register transfer level|RTL]], is turned into a design implementation in terms of logic gates (and,or,...) 


The **logic synthesizer** is an automatic tool that receives:
- the [[hardware/VLSI and IP/RTL - register transfer level|RTL]] description of the functionality 
- the technology **information** related to the cell library (for [[hardware/VLSI and IP/ASIC|ASIC]]) or the available cells (for [[hardware/VLSI and IP/FPGA|FPGA]])
- the constraints (area, timing, power)


The **logic synthesizer** translates the [[hardware/VLSI and IP/RTL - register transfer level|RTL]] description into a [[hardware/VLSI and IP/netlist|netlist]]
