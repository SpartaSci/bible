# design methodologies and style
## Full-custom design: 
>you design everything, sizing and positioning of each transistor, optimizing each component to achieve the best performance. 

Feasible for small designs or critical portions of larger designs, since is very time-consuming and complex.

## Semi-custom design: 
>you use pre-designed building blocks to construct circuits, such as basic gates and sequential elements 


**Application-Specific Integrated Circuits ([[hardware/VLSI and IP/ASIC|ASICs]])**: these use library of pre-designed components specific to certain applications.

## Programmable logic devices (PLDs):
> these devices have a predefined but flexible structure that can be programmed to implement various functions

Less optimized than semi-custom design, but they are valuable when **developing** new designs

these include programmable array logic (PAL), programmable logic arrays (PLA), complex programmable logic devices (CPLSs), and **field-programmable gate arrays ([[hardware/VLSI and IP/FPGA|FPGAs]])**
