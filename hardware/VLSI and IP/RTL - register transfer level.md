RTL: the modern design methodologgy operates at the register tranfer level. THhi level of abstraction uses building blocks provided in the library

RTL is a desgin abstraction that helps us focus on the logic and behaviour of the cirucit rather thant the underlying transistor details, with it we can describe our circuits using components like FF and gates [[hardware/VLSI and IP/netlist|netlist]]
