RTL: the modern design methodologgy operates at the register tranfer level. THhi level of abstraction uses building blocks provided in the library

RTL is a design abstraction that helps us **focus on the logic** and behaviour of the circuit **rather** than the underlying **transistor details**, with it we can describe our circuits using components like FF and gates [[hardware/VLSI and IP/netlist|netlist]]
