# ASIC Place & Route

>[[hardware/VLSI and IP/floorplanning|floorplanning]]: this step involves deciding how to organize the available space on our piece of silicon to implement the circuits


- position of the pin
- power supply information
- area for cells
- area for routing


>[[hardware/VLSI and IP/placement|placement]]: once the organization is defined, this step involves placing the cells properly

>[[hardware/VLSI and IP/routing|routing]]: this step involves connecting the placed cells together
