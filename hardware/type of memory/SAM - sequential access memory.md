In computing, **[sequential access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_access "Sequential access") [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory "Computer memory")** (**SAM**) is a class of [data storage devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage_device "Data storage device") that read stored data in a sequence. This is in contrast to [random access memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access_memory "Random access memory") (RAM) where data can be accessed in any order. Sequential access devices are usually a form of [magnetic storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_storage "Magnetic storage") or [optical storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_storage "Optical storage").
