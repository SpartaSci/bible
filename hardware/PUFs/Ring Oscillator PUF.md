N oscillators equal in the design but different in the physical characteristic.

The input challenge configure the two multiplexer to take two different ring oscillators

Possible different combinations with N = 16 -> $N(N-1)/2=120$
The counters count which is faster and compare. 

So 120 CRPs (Challenge Input multiplexer, response 1 or 0)
