# data remenance attack
> data remenance is the residual information remaining on storage media after cleaning, i.e. after the foreseen actions to remove or erase the target data


this result may result **from**:
- data being left intact by **nominal** file **deletion** operation
- by **reformatting** of storage media that does not remove data previously written to the media
- through **physical properties** of the storage media that allow previously written data to be recovered

an attacker with physical access to a computing system may just disconnect the memory chips and then retrive their content at disconnection time by analyzing them offline

we will focus more on volatile memory since is less 'obvious'
