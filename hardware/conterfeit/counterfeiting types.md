**Recycled**: used ICs provided by untrustworthy suppliers, which are recycled from used (*aged*) or defective (*non functional*) circuit boards.
Safety problems can be the shorter [[hardware/conterfeit/IC lifetime|lifetime]], the lower performance and the potential damage due to the reclaiming process.
From the security point of view instead *un-patched vulnerabilities*
The challenge with Recycled components is that their exact position on the [[hardware/conterfeit/IC lifetime|curve]] is unknown


**Remarked**: chemically or physically removing the original marking, maybe re-branding a components for a different design, same functionality but difference performance

**Overproduced**, [[hardware/_intro/chain/fabrication|Factory]] produces components beyond agreed quantities (loss in profits for the [[hardware/VLSI and IP/Intellectual Properties|IP]] owner), which can be sold illegitimately. Often their are not subjected to the same rigorous testing

**Out-of-Spec Defective**, after the components are produced, they go through some quality [[hardware/watermarking/testing|testing]] to ensure they match the specification described during the first step in the [[hardware/_intro/chain/design flow|design flow]], they may lack in performance or functionality


**Cloned** components may mimic the original's functionality but often lack the reliability and longevity. It is based on [[hardware/attack taxonomy/invasive attacks/reverse engineering|reverse engineering]] or stealing [[hardware/_intro/vulnerability|pirate IP]] 


**Tampered**: components modified to cause damage or make unauthorized alterations (introduce [[hardware/_intro/vulnerability|backdoors]]) [[hardware/_intro/Tamper-resistant devices|Tamper-resistant devices]]
