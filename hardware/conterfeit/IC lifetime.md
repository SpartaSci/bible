**Infant Mortality Phase**: the initial phase occurs right after the component is manufactured. During this period, many components fail due to [[hardware/_intro/chain/fabrication|manufacturing]] defects. 

**Normal lifetime**: the remaining components enter their normal operational phase. This is the period when the components are *most reliable* and are actively used in the market

**Wear-out phase**: As components age, they start to degrade and fail at increasing rates.
