**Physical inspection**: involves checking for physical anomalies like soldering quality and signs of reworking on mark. It is done with a *microscope* and X ray

**Electronic Inspection**: the component is tested for its operational functionality



**defect description**: 
- *texture variation* is usually a consequence of sanding or remarking. Machine learning help to detect anomalies that might be invisible to human inspectors
- *oxidation* and corrosion on leads are caused when a part is kept for a long time without proper protection
- *contamination* indicates that the component could potentially be recycled
- *ghost markings* appear when the counterfeiters do not remove entirely the original marking before printing the new one
