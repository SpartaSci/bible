**aging detectors**: sensors in the chip to capture the usage of the chip in the field. They rely on the aging effects of MOFSETs to change a [[electronics/Ring oscillator|Ring oscillator]] frequency in comparison with the golden one embedded in the chip

**hardware metering**: A set of security protocols that enable the design house to achieve the post-fabrication control of the produced ICs to prevent *overproduction*.
- post-manufacturing activation
- adding a [[hardware/watermarking/finite state machine|FSM]] which is initially locked and can be unlocked only with the correct sequence of primary inputs
- logic encryption
- **IC activation**
- **IP protection via Camouflage**


**PUFs**: [[hardware/PUFs/_PUFs - Physically Unclonable Functions|_PUFs - Physically Unclonable Functions]]
