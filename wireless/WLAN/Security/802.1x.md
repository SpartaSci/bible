>the IEEE 802.1x standard defines the encapsulation of the EAP protocol over IEEE 802 standard, which is also know as EAPoL  (EAP over LAN)
>Is the standard for access control



# authentication model
There are 3 entities:
- The **supplicant** *requests* access to the services (wants to connect to the network) 
- The **authenticator** *controls* access to the services (controls the state of a port) 
- The **authentication server** *authorized* access to the services

**Supplicant** authenticates itself to the **authentication server**, if the authentication is successful, the **authentication server** instructs the **authenticator** to switch the port on and then informs the **supplicant** that access is allowed.

Many protocols can be used as authentication methods in 802.1x: [[cybersec/defence/TLS|TLS]], [[cybersec/authentication/EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol|EAP]], [[cybersec/authentication/EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol|RADIUS]], [[cybersec/authentication/EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol|EAP-TLS]] ...

# from this model to WLAN
[[wireless/WLAN/_wlan|_wlan]]

**Supplicant** --> that's the role of the Mobile Device [[wireless/WLAN/WIFI|STA]]
**Authenticator** --> that's the role of the Access Point [[wireless/WLAN/WIFI|AP]]
**Authentication server** --> that's the role of the server application running on the AP or remote server
**Port** --> logical state implemented in software in the AP

One more thing is added to the basic 802.1x
**Successful authentication** results not only in switching the port on, but also in a **session key** between the *supplicant* and the *authentication server*. 
The session key is sent to the AP in a secure way, this assumes a share key between *authenticator* AP and *authentication server*. This is usually set up manually by the network administrator ^6e4993
