[[wireless/network/WWAN - Wireless Wide Area Network|WWAN - Wireless Wide Area Network]]

Mobile network allow radio user terminals, User Equipment or **Mobile Stations [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/_common/UE - User Equipment|MS]]** to connect to *global network infrastructure and services*

**Radio Access Network (RAN)**: which handles the radio *connectivity* with *users* 

**Core Network (CN)**: which *interconnects RAN* to external services and infrastructures and provides connectivity and mobility managements functions


# base station

[[wireless/WWAN - mobile/GSM/RAN/BTS - BS - base (transceiver) stations|BTS - BS - base (transceiver) stations]] are deployed in the service area to provide connectivity to [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/_common/UE - User Equipment|UEs]] in any position. The area where UEs connect to a specific BS is called he **cell**, which we can shape as as **hexagonal** 


# cluster model

**coverage planning**: where to place the antennas to cover an area

**capacity planning**: which *radio resources* can be used by each cells. The amount of resources (**frequencies**) assigned to cells determines the *system's capacity*



Access radio resources are shared among users of the *same cell* and of *different cell*

*Increasing the LA size*, we increase the signalling traffic due to [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/_common/Paging|Paging]]
*Decreasing the LA size*, we increase the signalling traffic due to [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/_common/Location update|Location update]]
