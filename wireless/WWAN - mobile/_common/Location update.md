**Location Update:** In the context of mobile networks, a location update refers to the process where a mobile device informs the network about its current location. 

This is crucial for the network to route incoming calls, messages, and data to the correct cell where the mobile device is currently located. 

Location updates occur when a mobile device moves into a new location area, such as entering a new cell or moving to a different tracking area.
