**Paging:** Paging is a mechanism used by mobile networks to locate and alert a mobile device when there is an incoming call, message, or data packet. The network initiates paging by broadcasting a paging message over the control channels of multiple cells within the area where the network believes the mobile device might be located. Upon receiving the paging message, the mobile device responds, allowing the network to establish the necessary communication link.
