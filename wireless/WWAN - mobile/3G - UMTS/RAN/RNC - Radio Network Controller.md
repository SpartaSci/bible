It do not do **managing**, it just connect [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/GSM/RAN/BTS - BS - base (transceiver) stations|BTS - BS - base (transceiver) stations]] to [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/GSM/CN/MSC - mobile switching center|MSC - mobile switching center]]


> RNC (Radio Network Controller): it is the main element of the UTRAN

>Responsible for controlling radio resources of all [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/3G - UMTS/RAN/NodeB|NodeB]] and mobility

> Due to additional functionalities, like soft-handover enabled by the [[signal analysis/signal multiplexing|CDMA]] radio interfaces, it has more functions than the [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/GSM/RAN/BSC - Base Station Controller|BSC - Base Station Controller]] in GSM, and an additional inter-RNC interface
