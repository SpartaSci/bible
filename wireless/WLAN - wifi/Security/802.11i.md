**WPA - WiFI Protected Access**

After the collapse of [[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Security/WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]], IEEE started to develop a new security architecture: **802.11i**. It improves Integrity, Encryption function and access control is based on [[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Security/802.1x|802.1x]]

Moreover:
- flexible authentication framework based on [[cybersec/authentication/EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol|EAP]]
- authentication can be based on strong protocol ([[TLS]])
- Different functions use different keys derived from the **session key** using a one-way function

Defines the concept of **RSN** (robust network security)
- **integrity** protection and **encryption** are based on AES 
- Nice but needs HW support

Defines an *optional* protocol called **TKIP** (temporary key integrity protocol):
- **integrity** is based on Michel 1
- **encryption** is still based on RC4, but no [[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Security/WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy#RC4 in WEP|WEP]] problem
- ugly solution but run on old HW

# auth model
[[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Security/802.1x|802.1x]]


# standard
The **IEEE 802.11i** standard defines 2 security protocols:
- WPA: an  optional protocol TKIP to allow backward compatibility with WEP
- WPA2: **Robust Network Security** concept. [[cybersec/enc/symmetric/block/AES|AES]] is the chosen cryptography algorithm for both confidentiality and integrity

[[cybersec/authentication/EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol|EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol]]



# access control
WPA supports 2 authentication key management protocols:
- Pre-Shared Key PSK Authentication: designed for **home and small office network**. Also referred as **WPA-Personal** 
- **IEEE [[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Security/802.1x]] and [[cybersec/authentication/EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol|EAP]] authentication**: requires a **centralized [[cybersec/authentication/EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol#RADIUS|RADIUS]]** authentication server. Mutual authentication is required. Also referred as **WPA-Enterprise**


# SRN - Robust Security Network Association 

There are different keys

**Master Session Key** MSK: allows exchange of encrypted messages so that only those devices with MSKs in common can decrypt it. MSK is in common between the *supplicant* and the *Radius server*. But we do not want to directly use it to encrypt.

**Pairwise Master Key** PMK: used to derive transient key to encrypt the message between *supplicant* and *authenticator*

**Pairwise Transient key** PTK: derived transient key used to encrypt the message between *supplicant* and *authenticator*

**Group Temporal key** GTK: key used for broadcast messages to everyone belonging to a specific group

**New GTK**: the next GTK in case of reboot or someone leaving the group

## design and goals

Provide confidentiality to each stations by **computing different keys** between each wireless client and AP. That's the role of the **PTK**

Support confidentiality in broadcast messages to all stations by **computing a shared key** for all stations in the WLAN. That's the role of the **GTK**


Derive multiple keys from a master key using a **PMK** to derive all other keys. PMKs should never be exposed.

**PMK** can be pre-shared as in the case of *WPA-Personal* or negotiated in the case of *WPA-Enterprise*


## Pairwise Transient Key Generation
The PTK is used to:
- for encryption and integrity checks in unicast user data flows
- also used for protecting the **4-way handshake**

PTK is derived by combining these attributes:
- PMK
- AP nonce
- STA nonce
- AP MAC address
- STA MAC address

These input are inserted in a pseudo-random function whose output is the PTK.

The nonces (random) are sent every time a client associates with the AP, and are needed since PMK and MAC are fixed, to achieve the **Transient Property**

# 4-way handshake

![[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Security/802.1x#^6e4993|802.1x]]

The exchanged EAPOL-key messages are 4 and constitute a 4-way handshake.

Both the AP *authenticator* AP and the client *supplicant* already share the **PMK**

The objectives of the handshake are:
- prove that AP also knows the PMK (result of the authentication)
- Exchange random values to be used in the generation of the PTK (PMK, Anonce, Snonce, AP and STA MAC)

## first message
The *AP* generates the **Anonce** value and send it to the client:
- this message is **un-encrypted** and has **no integrity check**
- if someone messes with this message, the handshake fail
- The *client* receives the message and **derives** the PTK, since it has all the pieces

## second message
The *client* send **Snonce** and a **MIC** (message integrity check):
- this message is **un-encrypted** but it foes have a MIC to prevent tempering
- the Key Confirmation Key **KCK**, which is 1/2 of the PTK just computed,  is used to calculate the MIC
- *AP* receives the message and **derives** the PTK, and then use KCK to **derives** the MIC
- if the MIC is the same, proves that the client and AP both have the same **PMK**

## third message
The *AP* sends message 3 that includes:
- Key installation request to ask the client to install the keys ^f6fffd
- MIC signature
- Group Transient Key GTK

The *client* receives message 3 and:
- compares received MIC with his MIC
- if the MIC is the same, proves that the client and AP both have the same **PMK**
- if positive the client **install** the PTK and GTK

## fourth message
The *client* sends an ACK to complete the 4-way handshake
- this is un-encrypted but includes a MIC


# Brute force attack against WPA2-personal

The **brute force attack** is the most common attack against WPA/WPA2
Start by capturing the handshake that allows the authentication key to be cracked offline

The handshake contains several pieces of information: SSID, Key (not directly), MACs, Nonces

The attack is possible since the PMK is computed in the following way:
$$PMK = Hash(Password, SSID, counters) 4090 times$$

# Integrity and Confidentiality in TKIP Mode
The TKIP mode is defined and mandatory for WPA. It still uses RC4 in order to be backward compatible to legacy devices [[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Security/WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]]


TKIP correct the flaws in the WEP so that the security is much enhanced in 3 aspects:
- CRC-32 is sill applied as the ICV to the message, but a **64-bit MIC** is also computed and appended to the message. The MIC is computed with the Michael keyed hash function
- The **IV space is incremented to 48 bits** in TKIP to prevent [[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Security/WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy#confidentiality and IV|IV reuse]]. The IV is also used as a **sequence counter** to prevent [[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Security/WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy#integrity and replay|replay attacks]]
- TKIP applies **per-packet keys** instead of using the pre-shared key to prevent attack on [[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Security/WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy#confidentiality and IV|weak keys]]

The packet key is a **hash of the PTK+IV**, the IV is longer and the keystream generated is more complex than in WEP, since TKIP implements a **key mixing function** that combines the **secret root key PTK** with the **IV** before passing it to the [[cybersec/enc/symmetric/stream/RC4|RC4]]. This is not just a concatenation as done in WEP

## TKIP weakness
TKIP is vulnerable to **MIC key recover**


# Integrity and Confidentiality in AES-CCMP Mode
> is the standard encryption protocol for use with WPA2 standard


**Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol** 

It means CTR mode and CBC-MAC:
- CCMP uses CTR with CBC-MAC for data confidentiality
- CCMP uses CBC-MAC for authentication and integrity
- CCMP encryption is based on AES processing and uses a 128-bit key and a 128-bit block size



# KRACK attack
The only major weakness in WPA2
