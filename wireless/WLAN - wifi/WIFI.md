> The core WIFI technology is based on IEEE 802.11 standards

Wi-Fi supports **infrastructure-based mode**: 
- comprises of an **Access Point** ([[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Access point|AP]]) and several **wireless stations** ([[wireless/WLAN - wifi/Wireless stations|STAs]])
- All STAs only communicate with the AP
- when two stations exchange data, all the traffic is sent twice on the wireless channel
- two stations cannot talk directly with each other because of the [Hidden Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_node_problem) problem
- this halves the performance

Wi-Fi supports **ad-hoc mode**:
- supports **direct communicatons** between the two Wi-Fi devices without a pre-deployed infrastructure
