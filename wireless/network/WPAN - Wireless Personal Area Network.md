> a WPAN can be used for communications among the **personal devices** themselves.


There are 2 types of **ad-hoc** networks:
- **Master-slave mode**: consist of a master node and multiple slave nodes. The master node defines a **cell**. The slaves nodes within the **piconet** connect to the master device. Bluetooth is a example
	- master will need to perform the main security operations
- **Mesh mode**: nodes are interconnected with wireless links without forming a specific cell. 
	- the routing complexity might increase in respect to a single slave mode
