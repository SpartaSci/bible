>provides wireless access to user equipment, or mobile stations [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/_common/UE - User Equipment|MS]]. Many base radio station [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/GSM/RAN/BTS - BS - base (transceiver) stations|BS]] to which mobile stations **MS** can connect to. The [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/3G - UMTS/RAN/RNC - Radio Network Controller|RNC]], radio network controller, connects different base stations.
# **Network Level**
>is the **backbone infrastructure** that connects all switches and routers in the networks. The [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/GSM/CN/MSC - mobile switching center|MSC]], *Mobile Switching Center*, coordinates the [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/3G - UMTS/RAN/RNC - Radio Network Controller|RNCs]] in order to fully cover at radio level and connect the [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/3G - UMTS/RAN/RNC - Radio Network Controller|RNCs]] to the internet.

# **Management Level**
> performs administrative operations of network service providers. [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/GSM/CN/HLR - Home Location Register|HLR - Home Location Register]] and [[wireless/WWAN - mobile/GSM/CN/VLR - Visitor Location Register|VLR - Visitor Location Register]], for roaming, are present.
