> a WWAN has the **largest service coverage** in all wireless comunication systems.


The general architecture of a WWAN has different components:
# **Radio Level**
>provides wireless access to user equipment, or mobile stations. Many base radio station **BS** to which mobile stations **MS** can connect to. The [[wireless/network/RNC - Radio Network Controller|RNC]], radio network controller, controls different base stations.
# **Network Level**
>is the **backbone infrastructure** that connects all switches and routers in the networks. The [[wireless/network/MSC - mobile switching center|MSC]], *Mobile Switching Center*, coordinates the [[wireless/network/RNC - Radio Network Controller|RNCs]] in order to fully cover at radio level and connect the [[wireless/network/RNC - Radio Network Controller|RNCs]] to the internet.

# **Management Level**
> performs administrative operations of network service providers. Authentication Center, Home Location and Visitor Location Register, for roaming, are present.
