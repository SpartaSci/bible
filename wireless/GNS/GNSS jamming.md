# jamming in [[wireless/GNS/_Global Navigation Satellite Systems|GNSS]]

Jamming's objective is **Denial of navigation services** by masking GNSS signals with noise.

Mass-market jammers usually aim at disturbing a wide band by [[signal analysis/modulation/analog carrier/analog data modulation#Frequency Modulation (FM)|frequency-modulating]] a pure tone


# methods to detect Jamming



## signal-to-noise monitoring

The interference can be modeled as an **additional contribution to the noise** variance. 
The receiver assumes that only **degrading source** is *uncorrelated thermal noise*
The receiver can define a statistical **threshold** based on $C/N0$ parameters

## spectral analysis 
The GNSS signal is weak and usually its spectrum is centered on the IF frequency at 4.1302 MHz.
When thereâ€™s interference it can be detected by looking at variations in the spectrum of the received signals.

## automatic gain control behavior
The main role of the **AGC** is to amplify or attenuate the input signal to **adapt** its amplitude to the *optimal input range* of the ADC

The ACG can also be a valuable tool for assessing the operating environment for GNNS receiver:
- in *absence of interference* the **gain** introduced by the AGC is almost **constant** over time
- in a *hostile environment* the average gain level is **lower** and not constant 
- if the gain becomes low, a very powerful signal was received, which may imply that the received signal is not a pure GNSS signal anymore

## goodness-of-fit test

The **goodness-of-fit test** performs the comparison of 2 probability density function allowing the decision between 2 hypothesis
1. If the [[wireless/Communications/Channel section communication#^60ae13|thermal noise]] is dominating the samples distribution, the histogram should exhibit a **Gaussian shape**
2. in presence of interference source, the histogram will **modify** its regular shape, enabling the test to **detect** such distortion


## machine learning

The model is then **trained** based on the detected jamming signals reported in literature and **perform feature extraction** from the raw samples collected after ADC at the front end

# mitigation

## notch filter
Is a type of band-stop filter, which is a filter that **attenuates** frequencies within a **specific range** while passing all other frequencies unaltered

The **adaptive notch filter** can be used against **swept frequency jammers**

## time domain pulse
**Digital pulse Blanking** can be used to remove pulsed interference acting on the time domain
